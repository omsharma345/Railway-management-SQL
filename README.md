- **Route Management**: Track stations, routes, and scheduling information.
- **Passenger Information**: Manage user registration and ticket bookings.
- **Ticket Booking System**: Enable ticket reservations, cancellations, and history tracking.
- **SQL Queries**: Include data insertion, updating, deletion, and retrieval.

## Technologies Used
- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Relational Database Concepts (Normalization, Foreign Keys, Constraints)

## How To Use
1. Import the `railway_system.sql` file into your SQL database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
2. Run the provided SQL scripts to create tables and relationships.
3. Perform insert, update, delete, and select operations to interact with the database.

Example to run (MySQL):
